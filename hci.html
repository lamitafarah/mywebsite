                        This project originated from a design brief presented in class, where the challenge was to revolutionize indoor navigation in large buildings and campuses using augmented reality (AR). The objective was to create a feature that would replace or enhance traditional signage. Users can effortlessly prompt the device through touch or voice commands, receiving real-time, contextual visual information to guide them through unfamiliar spaces.The task was to develop a low-fidelity prototype for this app.

                        The envisioned app offers users a unique experience exploring the eight royal parks of London.
                        It features AI-generated music that adapts to the user's chosen mood and dynamically changes based on their location within the park.                 
                        Additionally, users can use the app's augmented reality (AR) feature to view historical scenes of the park from the 19th century. 
                        The app includes a button for accessing historical information about statues and buildings within the park, enhancing the overall educational and immersive experience for users.
                        This was my final project for the year.
