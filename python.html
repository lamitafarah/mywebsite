                        In my first year of university, one of the first coding languages I learned was Python, an exciting yet challenging experience. Initially grasping the Python syntax, especially indentation, was challenging as it differed from other languages I had encountered.

                        Building a 2-player game in Python was a great learning experience that boosted my programming skills and problem-solving capabilities.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of game logic, user input handling, and the importance of structuring code for maintainability.
Debugging and optimizing code for a seamless gaming experience further developed my troubleshooting skills. </div>
